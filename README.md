Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  DriverPass desired to build a platform where students could complete training in preparation for their drivers exam. 
  The system included many things. Methods for scheduling, modifying, and cancelling drivers training.
   Updates from the DMV. Online exams and testing. Account creation.
  Admin roles could generate reports, manage accounts, and add and remove platform packages. 

What did you do particularly well?
  I feel confident that I accurately assesed the requirements needed to complete the project.
  I also demonstarted a knowledge of the system architecture needed to deploy a system liek they desired.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would revise the assignment where I documented the requirements. I feel like I did a good job, but I may have missed a few things. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  Using requirements to interpret the user's needs and create a backlog of tasks needed to complete those requirements.
  Without knowing the client's intentions and goals with the product, there is no chance to make a software to their satisfaction.
  Knowing the user's needs will allow you to create something they want and like. You won't have to create something twice.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  Personally, I like to start from the largest decisions and woork towards the smallest.
  Will it be cloud based or locally run? What methods and classes are needed? What is the background color?
  Starting with the major decisions and working towards the minor changes can allow you to create something 
  that is functional sooner in the SDLC.
